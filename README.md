# Netflix-EDA
A look into Netflix's library of licensed and original programming. I merged a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) with a dataset I exported from IMDB's list of all Netflix original movies and TV shows (https://www.imdb.com/list/ls093971121/). 

Background & Research Question::
According to a 2021 survey by Morgan Stanley on streaming services, 51 % of subscribers cite “good original programming” as a top reason for choosing Netflix. 
This EDA will explore the following question: How has Netflix’s content production changed over the years with respect to Genre and Country? Understanding Netflix's content strategy is vital for both Netflix and competing streaming services, to understand what captures viewers and keeps susbcribers happy.
